# Glassdoor Job Salary Prediction 🧠💼

This project aims to predict salaries from Glassdoor job listings using machine learning techniques. The model helps identify how job titles, company ratings, locations, and experience levels impact salary.

---

## 📊 Project Objective

To build a regression-based machine learning model that accurately predicts salaries using structured job listing data from Glassdoor. The project showcases skills in data cleaning, visualization, and model evaluation.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Tools & Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
- **ML Models Used**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

- Removed missing/null values
- Cleaned and transformed text columns (like job titles)
- Encoded categorical variables (like company size and industry)
- Removed outliers using quantiles

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized relationships between salary and:
  - Job title
  - Company rating
  - Location
  - Experience level
- Detected skewness and data imbalance
- Plotted histograms, heatmaps, and boxplots

---

## 🤖 Model Building & Evaluation

- Trained and tested multiple models (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Used `R² Score` and `MAE` to evaluate performance
- Best model: **Random Forest Regressor** with good accuracy and low error

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Senior roles generally have higher salaries
- Company rating and location impact salary
- Experience level is a strong predictor
